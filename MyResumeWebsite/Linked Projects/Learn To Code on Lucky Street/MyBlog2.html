                            Hi, my name’s Aaron. 
                            <br><br>
                            So I guess I’ve been a developer for about a month now. By developer, I mean I’ve been learning how to code with the plan on pursuing a career as a software developer. Yeah, so at the writing of this text, you could probably consider me very novice. But hey, a journey of a thousand miles has to start somewhere, right?  
                            <br><br>
                            Within this first month of learning to code I have built this site you are currently on from the ground up, as well as a few other things you could find here. More importantly, there are a few things you should know about me if you are going to read my posts. 
                            <br><br>
                            I’ve held many titles in my life: Ski-bum, Army Captain, Van-person, Strength Coach, Frat-boy, Security Guard, 4th Grade Teacher, and too many others to list if I’m being honest. Never in my wildest dreams had I thought Software Engineer might become one. But after moving to beautiful <a href="https://www.leadville.com/" target="_blank">Leadville, Colorado,</a> I started to realize a few things:
                             <br><br><br><br>

                             <button type="button" id="button"> Read More</button>
                            <br><br><br><br><br>

                            1. I want to build… To create… To innovate…
                            <br><br>
                            2. I crave a different kind of challenge than classroom management. I want to create things that don’t yet exist. 
                            <br><br>
                            3. I need to be on a career path with a higher income trajectory if I want to live the lifestyle that I do. 
                            <br><br>
                            4. I don’t want to leave where I live. Which means I need to find a career that I can do remotely. 
                            <br><br><br>
                            
                            Don’t get me wrong, I have always loved coaching and teaching in any capacity. I hope to be a part-time ski instructor until the day I die. And I know I will inevitably end up working in education again someday. But until then, I need a different kind of challenge. I need a career that encourages me to be creative, independent, and innovative. I want to push boundaries and create things. 
                            <br><br>
                            So I thought to myself, what is something that could fulfill all of those things? (I should mention that I have more friends than I could possibly count who are already in the field) Long story short, I took a chance and here I am. 100% committed to making this my career. 
                            <br><br>
                            First things first, I needed to figure out what exactly that meant I needed to learn. I lightly knew about a few different programming languages from talking with friends about it. I understood that if I wanted to get to the point where I could be hired as a junior developer, I needed to be proficient in a language. Since JavaScript is the most popular and widely used, it seemed like the logical starting point. However, I had made a website in the past using wordpress, Life on Lucky Street, and that was kind of fun. So I decided to start with the fundamental building blocks and work my way up. I’ve been hard charging HTML and CSS for the past month while slowly starting to dip my toes into JavaScript. I want to wait until I have a firm understanding with all three languages before I start dabbling in frameworks as well. I also want to learn about the things that give context and meaning to what I’m doing. I want to learn the history of software development.  
                            <br><br>
                            Speaking of frameworks though, there are two that I have developed for myself over the years, to be what I believe is the key to learning anything. You can read about them in the following post here. 
                            <br><br>
                            The moral of the story is I really want to learn this stuff and become good at it. I want to get to the point where the only limitation is my imagination. 
                            <br><br>
                            And this website is another step in that direction... 
                            <br><br>
                            Read along if you want, maybe you will learn a thing or two. Maybe something will catch your interest. If you aren’t in the industry, but maybe you’ve always thought about trying it out, let me show you anything is possible with the right mindset. Let me show you that when you live on Lucky Street, you can do anything.
