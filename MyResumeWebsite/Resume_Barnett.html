This period started my new strategy of putting in 1.5 hours a day, 4 days a week. This has allowed me to both keep up with my professional commitments, while also continuing learning. Each 1.5 hour day is used differently now. One session is used for strictly new learning and reading. One section is used for playing with code in the code editor. One section is used to try and build new things while utilizing documentation and reources from the web, and the final block is spent to review what I have covered that week.   </td>
